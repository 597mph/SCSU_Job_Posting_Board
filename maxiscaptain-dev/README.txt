!README!

The site should run properly immediately if you clone the repo. This assumes that the database is turned on and that you have all the necessary modules installed.

There are some default user objects that are created by init.py, for the sake of the database. However, do not use these users to log in as the site will throw an error.

We encourage you to log in using: mike (PW: mike) (role: student), andy
(PW: andy) (role: faculty), and jessica (PW: jessica) (role: employer).

We are not sure whether you intend to clone the repo and actually use it. If you do
intend to run the site, Maxwell will need to be informed in order to start the database instance, as the site will not post until it can establish a connection to the SQL server.

Feel free to create any user you like; every piece of (role-specific) functionality in the site works with any and all users. We did not create new users during our presentation demo because we did not want to focus on mundane features (as instructed). Surely, however, nothing in the project is hard coded. I realize in hindsight that it may have appeared that way during our presentation.

Something I (Maxwell) would have liked to implement before the presentation is delete buttons for students who want to rescind their application to a listing, and for employers who have active listings that have since obsolesced.

One last thing I want to add: Cara, Brec, Steve, Maxi and I all put our best foot forward to make this site the best it could be given the timeframe and everyone's complex schedules. While you never can truly create the perfect product, we are still very proud of what we have created here, and we all learned a lot during the process. This class is a great taste of what goes in the real computer science world, and we will definitely be taking the things we learned into our future endeavors.

Thank you, professor, and have a great summer!
